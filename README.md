# Covid-19 Analysis to visualize and understand the pandemic cases using different Techniques. 

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) time series lists confirmed cases, reported deaths, active cases and comparison with other Epidemics. 
Data are disaggregated by country (and sometimes subregion). 
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by the
[Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2) and has had a worldwide effect.

This notebook uses data from various sources to understand, analyze and visualize the changes in the number of cases through different visualization techniques and plots.

This dataset includes time-series data tracking the number of people affected by COVID-19 worldwide, including:

- confirmed tested cases of Coronavirus infection
- number of people who have reportedly died due to Coronavirus
- number of people who have reportedly recovered from it

**Note:** The Data collection for **Recovered cases** isn't quite accurate and has been stopped by a lot of countries and it is also found discrepancies in data if taken from multiple sources. Also a lot of recovery cases aren't reported and it is not possible to analyze them accurately. Yet the data reported till July 2020, is quite accurate to understand. You can select from Jan2020 to Jan 2021 to clearly see the transition in all the graphs.  

Therefore the following two scenarios should also be kept in mind:
- Active Cases are calculated based on recoveries so this will not be also correct
- Anything that requires recoveries in the calculation isn't accurate, like deaths/100recoveries, etc.

**Additional References** for the above point:

Most of these reports are based on the US but mostly it is true for the rest of the world.
